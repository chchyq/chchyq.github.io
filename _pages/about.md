Hi! My name is Erica, a senior undergraduate student majoring in information security in School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology.

Life
======
* I like tasting delicious food! As a result, I also "enjoy" going to gym. 
* I am also fond of singing! I was in the chorus when I was in junior and senior school. I joined an acappella group in my campus life. My teacher once said, he would be much happier to perform on the stage rather than got 1st in an exam. Actually I prefer to be 1st in exam!
* Whistling has more chances to accompany me than singing. Because I can whistle everywhere without worry. If you sing everywhere, someone may glare at you.
